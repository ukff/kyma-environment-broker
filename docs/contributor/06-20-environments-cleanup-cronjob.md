Environments Cleanup CronJob removes Kyma Environments which are older than 24h. The CronJob is scheduled to run daily at midnight local time defined in the system.

## Prerequisites

Environments Cleanup requires access to:

* Gardener project of choice to filter Shoots without a proper label and remove lingering shoots
* the Kyma Environment Broker (KEB) database to get an Instance ID for each SAP BTP, Kyma runtime marked for deletion
* KEB to trigger Kyma runtime deprovisioning
* Kubernetes client to clean up Runtime CRs created directly using Kyma Infrastructure Manager and omitting KEB
